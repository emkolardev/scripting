- For the ‘HTML Cheatsheet’ I created a silly mockup of a webpage about cats (sort of). You can hover over any of the page elements to see their tag names, and click them to read their documentation pages on W3 Schools.

- The markup language .pdf is pretty self explanatory (just an attempt at making a markup/markdown).
